The Data
===

- This small application demonstrates ad hoc data investigation in features related to the carbon footprint of mid-70's automobiles
- This data was extracted from the 1974 issue of Motor Trend, an US automobile magazine. 
- The data comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models). 

Summary
===
```{r result='asis'}
data(mtcars)
knitr::kable(head(mtcars,5))
```

Data Analysis 
===

- Select features by moving the `Predictor` and the `Outcome` drop bown boxes 
- The dashboard will show a linear interpolation between the features selected. 
- The shaded area represents the **95% confidence interval** of the linear prediction.
- You can additionally select a `Clustered` featured in the third drop-down box to add colors to points as a way to help visualize clusters.

Sample Visualization & Data Insights
====

- The outcome `mpg` is negativelly correlated to all regressors
- All regressors are positivelly correlated amongst themselves
- This application is available for use [here](https://jfaleiro.shinyapps.io/carbonfootprint/)
